  <center><h1><u>LORD RAMA</u></h1></center>
  <P>*** According to the Ramayana, <b>Rama was born to Kausalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, the capital of the Kingdom of Kosala.</b>b His siblings included Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. <u>He married Sita.</u> Born in a royal family, Rama's life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes, such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, and challenges of ethical questions and moral dilemmas Of all his travails,<mark> the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king Ravana, </mark>followed by the determined and epic efforts of<i> Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds.</i></P>

    <p>*** <i>The entire life story of Rama, Sita and their companions allegorically discusses duties,</i> rights and <b>social responsibilities of an individual.</b> It illustrates <mark>dharma and dharmic living through model characters.</mark></p>
    
    <p>*** <b>Rama is especially important to Vaishnavism.</b> He is the central figure of <i>the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana, </i>a text historically popular in the South Asian and Southeast Asian cultures.<u>His ancient legends have attracted bhashya (commentaries) </u>and extensive secondary literature and inspired performance arts. Two such texts, for example, are <mark>the Adhyatma Ramayana a spiritual and theological treatise considered foundational by Ramanandi monasteries,</mark> and the Ramcharitmana a popular treatise that inspires thousands of Ramlila festival performances during autumn every year in India.</p>
